          Filing your Income Tax Return (ITR) may seem complicated at first, but if you understand the basics, it can be straightforward. This guide will help you understand how income tax works under the old tax regime and the steps to file your return.
        </p>
        <h3>What is the Old Regime?</h3>
        <p class="blog-text">
          The Government allows taxpayers to choose between two systems to calculate tax: the old regime and the new regime.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <b>old regime</b> allows you to claim various <b>exemptions and deductions</b> (like HRA, LTA, 80C, 80D, etc.).</li>
          <li>The <b>new regime</b> has lower tax rates but fewer deductions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you have investments in insurance, provident fund, or housing loan, the old regime often works better.</p>
        <h3>
          Income Tax Slabs under Old Regime (for FY 2024-25)
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Here are the basic slab rates for individuals below 60 years of age:
        </p>
        <ul class="blog-text">
          <li>Income up to ₹2.5 lakh – No tax</li>
          <li>₹2.5 lakh to ₹5 lakh – 5%</li>
          <li>₹5 lakh to ₹10 lakh – 20%</li>
          <li>More than ₹10 lakh – 30%</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, cess of 4% is applicable on the calculated tax.</p>
        <p><i>(Note: Senior citizens and super-senior citizens have higher exemption limits.)</i></p>
        <h3>Common Deductions You Can Claim</h3>
        <p class="blog-text">The old regime is beneficial if you use these deductions:</p>
        <ul class="blog-text">
          <li>Section 80C: Up to ₹1.5 lakh for investments like PPF, ELSS, Life Insurance, EPF, housing loan principal, etc.</li>
          <li>Section 80D: Health insurance premium (₹25,000 for self/family and ₹50,000 for senior citizens).</li>
          <li>Section 24(b): Home loan interest up to ₹2 lakh.</li>
          <li>HRA Exemption: For salaried individuals living in rented houses.</li>
          <li>LTA: Leave Travel Allowance exemption.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps to File Income Tax Return</h3>
        <ol class="blog-text">
          <li>Collect Documents: Form 16 (from your employer), interest certificates from the bank, proof of investments, loan statements.</li>
          <li>Register/Login at the official Income Tax e-filing portal.</li>
          <li>Choose the Correct ITR Form:</li>
          <ul class="blog-text">
            <li>ITR-1 (Sahaj): For salaried individuals with income up to ₹50 lakh.</li>
            <li>ITR-2 or ITR-3: If you have other income sources like capital gains or business.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Fill Your Income Details: Salary, house property income, bank interest, etc.</li>
          <li>Claim Deductions under Sections like 80C, 80D, and others.</li>
          <li>Verify Tax Liability: The portal auto-calculates your tax based on old regime rules.</li>
          <li>Submit and E-Verify: You can verify through Aadhaar OTP, net banking, or sending a signed ITR-V form to CPC, Bengaluru.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Why File an ITR Even If Income is Below Taxable Limit?</h3>
        <ul class="blog-text">
          <li>To claim a refund of excess TDS deducted.</li>
          <li>As proof of income for loans, visas, or financial transactions.</li>
          <li>To keep a clean financial record with the IT department.</li>
        </ul>
